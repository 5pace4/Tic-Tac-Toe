# Tic-Tac-Toe Game

## Introduction
Welcome to the Tic-Tac-Toe game repository! This simple console-based Python game allows two players to compete against each other in the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game.

## Description
Tic-Tac-Toe is a two-player game where each player takes turns marking a cell in a 3x3 grid with their symbol ('X' or 'O'). The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row is declared the winner. The game ends in a draw if the entire board is filled without a winner.

## Playing Rules
1. The game is played on a 3x3 grid.
2. Players take turns marking an empty cell with their symbol ('X' or 'O').
3. The game ends when a player wins by having three of their symbols in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) or when the board is full, resulting in a draw.
4. Players are prompted to input the cell number where they want to place their symbol.
5. Invalid moves are not allowed, and the player must choose an empty cell.

2. Open a terminal or command prompt.
3. Navigate to the directory where the game is located.
